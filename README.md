Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
it's the systematically application of pricipes methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality systems 
Importance 
creation of software application 
creation of system that power various aspects of modern life 
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
machine code programming 
high level languages
machine structure.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
requirements gathering and analysis 
design 
development 
testing 
deployment 
maintenance and support.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
 Waterfall refers to development process where each phase must be completed before the next begins.eg small projects with strict regulatory.while Agile breaks down projects into smaller manegeable cycles and prioritize customer satisfaction through continous feedback.eg project where customer involvement is essential.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer 
Technical skills - proficient in programming language relevant to the project.
Quality assurance engineer 
Analytical skills - Ability to analyze requirements and design test to ensure software quality.
Project manager 
Leadership skills - Ability to lead and mobilize a team and drive projects into success.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs 
Productivity enhancement - provides a comprehensive set of tools which speeds up development by streamlining tasks.
Eg- Visual studio code.
 VCEs
 Audit trail- Maintains history of changes with commit messages which helps in understanding evolution of the project and tracking contributions.
 Eg-Git.
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Requirement changes- Frequent changes in project requirements can lead to scope creep impacting timelessness.
solution 
implement Agile methodologies 
Debugging and Testing - identify and fixing bugs particularly in complex system can be time consuming.
Solution 
Use comprehensive testing strategies.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit- Involves testing of individual components of a software application form the rest of the system.
Importance 
Early detection of bugs.
Integration testing - Verifys the interaction between different modules or service within a system.
importance - Detects interface issues.
Eg. TESTNG
System -  Testing the complete and intergrated software system to validate that it meets specified requirements.
Importance - End-End Testing.
Eg  Quick Test Professional.
Acceptance- Assesses whether the software meets the business requirements and is ready for delivarance to its end users 
Importance - Validation of Requirements.
Eg Alpha Testing.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering refers to the practice of designing and refining inputs given to Ai models particularly those based on natural language processing.
Importance- Contextual understanding help Ai models to understand the context of query leading to more accurate responses.
Facillitates better task execution by giving a specific task response.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
prompt- tell me about climate change.
it has clarity
specificity
conciseness
